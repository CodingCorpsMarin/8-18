Competencies

Ruby enumerable methods are similar to enumerable methods in many other languages
Enumberables are often written in block notation
Blocks are the code between a “do” and an “end”
Blocks can also be encapsulated in curly braces { } instead of “do” and “end”
Block parameters are declared in between pipes ||, they are what will be operated upon in the following code
Enumerable methods include “each”, “reduce”, “select”, “filter”, “reject”, etc. See them all in the Ruby docs
