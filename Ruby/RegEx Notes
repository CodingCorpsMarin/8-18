Competencies

Regular Expressions allow you to select certain sets of characters like “all integers”, or “all capital letters” without having to declare a set of all integers/capital letters
Very useful in matching algorithms, password validity checking, etc
For ruby, use Rubular.com as a reference for most regex matchers

Applications

Make algos using regex for easier processing/shorter code
